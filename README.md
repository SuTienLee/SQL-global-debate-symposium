# SQL-global-debate-symposium

This SQL-based project defined the **recruitment, cost-saving, and marketing problems** for our client Global Debate Symposium (GDS). We built the entity-relationship diagram, relational schema, database model in SQL and wrote queries to answer the questions, and provided insights and recommendations to improve our client's database to future-proof its growing needs and expand its business opportunities.

This project was contributed by MS Business Analytics and Information Management students at Purdue University:
> Meghan Harris, Michael Jonelis, Piper Doyle, Rachel Fagan, Su-Tien Lee, Yi-Chen Chiou (In alphabetical order)

In the codes file, we created eleven SQL queries based on the business problem that we would like to answer.
